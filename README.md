# Learning Python

This is a collection of small projects I'm using to learn Python. The projects are all from [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ext9G7xspg&t=5269s) made by Kylie Ying for the FreeCodeCamp channel.

## How to run

To check each project, make sure you have Python installed. You must clone this repo into your local machine
```
git clone https://github.com/fpmrqs/learning-python
```
